final project stage 1 proposal

Project: A file sharing system based on the Chord protocol

Details: 

The project will build on the basic peerster design and implement

1. An id space for nodes and keys(SHA1 hashes of file names)

2. Finger tables for fast (O(logn)) lookup of a given id

3. Update finger table when nodes join/leave

Nodes will use the basic gui and file download technique already
implemented in previous labs.

Functions not being implement/Drawbacks of the system:

1. Only easy to search for a given,specific key; not implementing a fast
	method. File ids must either be entered directly, or use the existing
	slower flood search method

2. Vulnerable to DoS attacks, sybil attacks and network churn (esp for popular keys)

3. Does not preserve locality of nodes.

4. Note that files have a max size of a few MB (as per lab 3 implementation.


Concluding note:

The main purpose of this project is to implement a basic chord protocol system
that can do quick searches for a given id. Most of the logic for this system
is available from the Chord paper (Stoica et al.) 
In case this project turns out to be much easier to implement that I anticipate, 
I intend to expand some of the basic functionalities of peerster, in line with 
the challenges suggested in lab 3
